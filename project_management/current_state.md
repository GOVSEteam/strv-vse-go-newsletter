## 1. Overview

This document provides a snapshot of the current implementation state of the Go Newsletter Platform as of the latest code analysis. It serves as a reference for understanding what has been completed, what needs improvement, and what remains to be implemented according to the defined RFCs.

The codebase shows a solid foundation with clean architecture, proper separation of concerns, and Firebase Auth integration for editor authentication. Several components of RFC-001 and RFC-002 are implemented, with partial implementation of RFC-003.

## 4. Next Priority Steps

With core subscriber and publishing flows largely in place, priorities shift towards robustness, testing, and usability:

1.  **Implement Authentication Middleware (RFC-002, `API-AUTH-002`):**
    - Create a middleware for consistent JWT verification across all protected API endpoints. This is crucial for security and cleaner handler logic.
2.  **Comprehensive Testing (RFC-003, RFC-004, RFC-005, RFC-006):**
    - Write unit and integration tests for:
      - Newsletter and Post CRUD operations.
      - All subscriber management flows (subscribe, confirm, unsubscribe, list subscribers).
      - The complete publishing flow.
3.  **Email Enhancements (RFC-005):**
    - Develop proper HTML email templates for newsletter issues.
    - Investigate and implement asynchronous email sending for better performance.
4.  **Pagination for List Endpoints (RFC-006, RFC-003):**
    - Implement pagination for listing subscribers.
    - Review and implement pagination for listing newsletters and posts if not already robust.
5.  **Database Migrations (RFC-001, `PLAT-005`):**
    - Select and set up a database migration tool for managing schema changes.
6.  **Non-Functional Requirements (RFC-007):**
    - Begin addressing API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
    - Standardize error handling further.
    - Implement a logging strategy.

Addressing these will make the platform more robust, maintainable, and production-ready.
