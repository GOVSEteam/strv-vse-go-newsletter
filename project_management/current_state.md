## 1. Overview

This document provides a snapshot of the current implementation state of the Go Newsletter Platform as of the latest code analysis. It serves as a reference for understanding what has been completed, what needs improvement, and what remains to be implemented according to the defined RFCs.

The codebase shows a solid foundation with clean architecture, proper separation of concerns, and Firebase Auth integration for editor authentication. Several components of RFC-001 and RFC-002 are implemented, with partial implementation of RFC-003.

## 3. RFC Status Details

### RFC-001: Project Setup & Tooling
**Status: Mostly Complete (80%)**

#### Implemented
- ✅ Go modules setup with appropriate dependencies (`go.mod`, `go.sum`)
- ✅ PostgreSQL connection logic (`internal/setup-postgresql/db.go`)
- ✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialization (`internal/setup-firebase/firebase.go`)
- ✅ Clean architecture project structure (layers: handler, service, repository)
- ✅ Initial database schema (`tables/editors.sql`, `tables/newsletters.sql`)
- ✅ HTTP server setup with basic routing (`cmd/server/main.go`, `internal/layers/router/router.go`)
- ✅ Environment variable loading with godotenv

#### Needs Improvement
- ⚠️ No health checking or proper error handling for Firebase initialization

#### Missing
- ❌ CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions or similar)
- ❌ Database migration system for applying SQL schemas
- ❌ Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- ❌ Tests for basic setup components

#### Next Steps
1. Create a proper migration system for database schemas
2. Fix environment variable naming for Firebase Web API Key
3. Add CI/CD configuration
4. Add comprehensive README with setup instructions

---

### RFC-002: Editor Auth & Account Management
**Status: Mostly Complete (85%)**

#### Implemented
- ✅ Editor registration via Firebase Auth (`internal/layers/handler/editor/signup.go`)
- ✅ Editor login via Firebase Auth REST API (`internal/layers/handler/editor/signin.go`)
- ✅ JWT verification for Firebase tokens (`internal/auth/jwt.go`)
- ✅ Local editor records linked to Firebase users (`internal/layers/repository/editor.go`)
- ✅ Basic input validation for registration/login requests

#### Needs Improvement
- ⚠️ JWT verification is only applied to newsletter creation, not consistently across all protected endpoints
- ⚠️ Error handling is basic; could benefit from more detailed error responses
- ⚠️ No rate limiting or additional security measures for authentication endpoints

#### Missing
- ❌ Password reset functionality (though likely delegated to Firebase client-side)
- ❌ Middleware for applying JWT verification consistently
- ❌ Tests for auth flows

#### Next Steps
1. Create a middleware for JWT verification to apply consistently
2. Implement or document the password reset flow
3. Improve error handling for authentication endpoints
4. Add tests for auth flows

---

### RFC-003: Newsletter CRUD
**Status: Mostly Complete (95%)**

#### Implemented
- ✅ **All core CRUD Endpoints:**
    - ✅ `POST /api/newsletters` (Create)
    - ✅ `GET /api/newsletters` (List by editor, with pagination)
    - ✅ `PATCH /api/newsletters/{id}` (Update name/description)
    - ✅ `DELETE /api/newsletters/{id}` (Delete)
- ✅ **Ownership & Uniqueness:**
    - ✅ Single-editor ownership enforced via JWT and editor ID checks.
    - ✅ Newsletter name uniqueness per editor enforced (service layer check, 409 Conflict).
- ✅ **Validation & Error Handling:**
    - ✅ Input validation for request bodies, path parameters, and pagination parameters.
    - ✅ Standardized JSON error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 409, 500).
    - ✅ Specific handling for `sql.ErrNoRows` (for 404) and `service.ErrNewsletterNameTaken` (for 409).
- ✅ **Data Models & Repository:**
    - ✅ `newsletters` table schema defined with `id`, `editor_id`, `name`, `description`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - ✅ Repository methods for all CRUD operations, including ownership checks and pagination support for lists.
- ✅ **Testing:**
    - ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for all handler logic (Create, List, Update, Delete) covering success, auth, validation, and service error cases.
    - ✅ Comprehensive integration tests for all API endpoints, interacting with a real database, covering various scenarios including "not found" and "name conflict".
- ✅ **Refactoring & Structure:**
    - ✅ Split monolithic newsletter handler into specific files (`create.go`, `list.go`, `update.go`, `delete.go`).
    - ✅ Introduced common response helpers (`internal/layers/handler/response.go`).
    - ✅ `ListNewsletters` in repository and service refactored to `ListNewslettersByEditorID` with pagination and total count.
    - ✅ `UpdatedAt` field added to `Newsletter` model and handled in repository.

#### Needs Improvement/Refinement (Minor)
- ⚠️ Consider adding max length validation for newsletter `name` and `description` as a general hardening step (not explicitly in RFC scope).
- ⚠️ Service layer error differentiation: If the service layer were to introduce more *specific user-correctable* validation errors (beyond name conflicts), handlers would need to map them to appropriate 4xx codes. Currently, other service errors default to 500.

#### Pending Dependencies
- ⏳ **Subscriber Deletion on Newsletter Delete:** The acceptance criterion "Related data handled on delete" regarding subscribers is pending the completion of RFC-004 (Subscriber Management). A `TODO` is in place in `NewsletterService.DeleteNewsletter`.
- ℹ️ **Post Deletion on Newsletter Delete:** Deletion of related posts will be handled by `ON DELETE CASCADE` in the (future) `posts` table schema, similar to how `editor` deletion cascades. This is a forward-looking note for the RFC related to Posts.

#### Next Steps (for this RFC)
- None. Core functionality is complete. Outstanding items are dependencies or minor optional refinements.

- ❌ Unique link generation for newsletters (*Likely related to publishing or specific confirmation links for content, not account confirmation*)
- ⚠️ Tests for subscriber management (*Unit tests for subscribe, unsubscribe & confirmation handler/service done; Integration tests pending API enablement and full flow testing*)

#### Next Steps
1. Verify subscribe, unsubscribe, and confirmation flows once Firestore API is enabled.
2. Add integration tests for these flows (once API is enabled).
3. Plan and implement a real email service integration (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES) when ready.
