- ✅ Uses an `EmailService` interface for sending confirmation emails (actual email sending via provider is part of RFC-005/MAIL-001).

#### Missing

- ❌ Robust Firebase Firestore integration for subscribers (`DB-004`). Current repository might be a placeholder.
- ❌ Unsubscribe functionality using a unique token (current is by email & newsletterID, `API-SUB-002` specifies token).

#### Next Steps

1. Solidify Firebase Firestore integration for subscriber data storage and retrieval.
2. Implement token-based unsubscription.
3. Integrate with a chosen email service for robust confirmation email sending (`MAIL-002`).
4. Add comprehensive tests for all subscriber flows.

- ✅ API Endpoints for Post CRUD (`POST /api/newsletters/{nid}/posts`, `GET /api/newsletters/{nid}/posts`, `GET /api/posts/{id}`, `PUT /api/posts/{id}`, `DELETE /api/posts/{id}`). (Corresponds to `API-POST-001`)

#### Missing

## 4. Next Priority Steps

Based on the current state and dependencies between RFCs, the following steps should be prioritized:

1.  **Implement Authentication Middleware (RFC-002, `API-AUTH-002`):**
    - Create a middleware for consistent JWT verification across all protected API endpoints. This is crucial before extensive frontend integration or exposing more features.
2.  **Testing for Newsletters & Posts (RFC-003, `TEST-002`, `TEST-005` partially):**
    - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all Newsletter and Post CRUD operations and their API endpoints.
3.  **Solidify Subscriber Management (RFC-004):**
    - Ensure robust Firebase Firestore integration for subscriber data.
    - Implement token-based unsubscription (`API-SUB-002`).
    - Thoroughly test subscriber flows (`TEST-003`).
4.  **Implement Publishing Flow Core (RFC-005):**
    - Integrate an email service like Resend (`MAIL-001`, `MAIL-003`).
    - Implement the `/posts/{id}/publish` endpoint (`API-PUB-001`) to fetch subscribers and send them the post content.
5.  **Database Migrations (RFC-001, `PLAT-005`):**
    - Select and set up a database migration tool.

The completion of these steps will significantly advance the platform's core functionalities.
