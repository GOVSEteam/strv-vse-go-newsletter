## 1. Overview

This document provides a snapshot of the current implementation state of the Go Newsletter Platform as of the latest code analysis. It serves as a reference for understanding what has been completed, what needs improvement, and what remains to be implemented according to the defined RFCs.

The codebase shows a solid foundation with clean architecture, proper separation of concerns, and Firebase Auth integration for editor authentication. Several components of RFC-001 and RFC-002 are implemented, with partial implementation of RFC-003.

## 3. RFC Status Details

### RFC-001: Project Setup & Tooling
**Status: Mostly Complete (80%)**

#### Implemented
- ✅ Go modules setup with appropriate dependencies (`go.mod`, `go.sum`)
- ✅ PostgreSQL connection logic (`internal/setup-postgresql/db.go`)
- ✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialization (`internal/setup-firebase/firebase.go`)
- ✅ Clean architecture project structure (layers: handler, service, repository)
- ✅ Initial database schema (`tables/editors.sql`, `tables/newsletters.sql`)
- ✅ HTTP server setup with basic routing (`cmd/server/main.go`, `internal/layers/router/router.go`)
- ✅ Environment variable loading with godotenv

#### Needs Improvement
- ⚠️ No health checking or proper error handling for Firebase initialization

#### Missing
- ❌ CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions or similar)
- ❌ Database migration system for applying SQL schemas
- ❌ Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- ❌ Tests for basic setup components

#### Next Steps
1. Create a proper migration system for database schemas
2. Fix environment variable naming for Firebase Web API Key
3. Add CI/CD configuration
4. Add comprehensive README with setup instructions

---

### RFC-002: Editor Auth & Account Management
**Status: Mostly Complete (95%)**

#### Implemented
- ✅ Editor registration via Firebase Auth (`internal/layers/handler/editor/signup.go`)
- ✅ Editor login via Firebase Auth REST API (`internal/layers/handler/editor/signin.go`)
- ✅ JWT verification for Firebase tokens (`internal/auth/jwt.go`)
- ✅ Local editor records linked to Firebase users (`internal/layers/repository/editor.go`)
- ✅ Basic input validation for registration/login requests
- ✅ Password reset flow using Firebase Auth REST API (`internal/layers/handler/editor_password_reset.go`)

#### Needs Improvement
- ⚠️ JWT verification is only applied to newsletter creation, not consistently across all protected endpoints
- ⚠️ Error handling is basic; could benefit from more detailed error responses
- ⚠️ No rate limiting or additional security measures for authentication endpoints

#### Missing
- ❌ Middleware for applying JWT verification consistently
- ❌ Tests for auth flows

#### Next Steps
1. Create a middleware for JWT verification to apply consistently
2. Improve error handling for authentication endpoints
3. Add tests for auth flows

---

### RFC-003: Newsletter CRUD
**Status: Partially Complete (40%)**

#### Implemented
- ✅ Create Newsletter with proper JWT auth and editor linkage
- ✅ List Newsletters (public endpoint, no auth required)
- ✅ Basic data models and repositories

#### Needs Improvement
- ⚠️ List endpoint doesn't filter by editor (shows all newsletters)
- ⚠️ Create endpoint has minimal validation
- ⚠️ Error handling is minimal

#### Missing
- ❌ Update/Rename Newsletter functionality
- ❌ Delete Newsletter functionality
- ❌ Ownership checks for newsletter operations beyond creation
- ❌ Pagination for list endpoint
- ❌ Tests for newsletter operations

#### Next Steps
1. Implement PATCH endpoint for updating newsletter name/description
2. Implement DELETE endpoint for removing newsletters
3. Add ownership verification for all operations
4. Add pagination for list endpoint
5. Add tests for all CRUD operations

---

### RFC-004: Subscriber Management
**Status: Not Started (0%)**

#### Implemented
- None

#### Missing
- ❌ Firebase Firestore integration for subscribers
- ❌ Subscribe to newsletter endpoint
- ❌ Confirmation email functionality
- ❌ Unsubscribe functionality
- ❌ Unique link generation for newsletters
- ❌ Tests for subscriber management

#### Next Steps
1. Set up Firebase Firestore for subscriber data
2. Implement subscribe endpoint with unique links
3. Integrate with email service for confirmation emails
4. Implement unsubscribe functionality
5. Add tests for subscriber flows

---

### RFC-005: Publishing & Email Delivery
**Status: Not Started (0%)**

#### Implemented
- None

#### Missing
- ❌ Posts table in PostgreSQL
- ❌ Endpoints for creating/retrieving posts
- ❌ Email service integration
- ❌ Email delivery to subscribers
- ❌ Email templates
- ❌ Tests for publishing and email delivery

#### Next Steps
1. Create posts table schema
2. Implement endpoints for publishing posts
3. Integrate with chosen email service
4. Implement email delivery to subscribers
5. Add tests for publishing flows

---

### RFC-006: List Subscribers
**Status: Not Started (0%)**

#### Implemented
- None

#### Missing
- ❌ Endpoint for listing subscribers of a newsletter
- ❌ Authentication and ownership checks
- ❌ Pagination for potentially large subscriber lists
- ❌ Tests for subscriber listing

#### Next Steps
1. Implement endpoint for retrieving subscribers
2. Add proper auth and ownership checks
3. Implement pagination
4. Add tests

---

### RFC-007: Non-Functional: Docs, Quality, Naming
**Status: Minimally Started (10%)**

#### Implemented
- ✅ Basic code structure follows clean architecture principles
- ✅ Some naming conventions are followed

#### Needs Improvement
- ⚠️ Inconsistent error handling
- ⚠️ Minimal logging
- ⚠️ No structured API responses

#### Missing
- ❌ API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- ❌ Comprehensive project documentation
- ❌ Consistent error handling
- ❌ Logging strategy
- ❌ Code quality checks in CI
- ❌ Performance considerations

#### Next Steps
1. Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
2. Improve project documentation
3. Implement consistent error handling
4. Add proper logging
5. Set up code quality checks

---

### RFC-008: Optional: Social Auth
**Status: Not Started (0%)**

#### Implemented
- None

#### Missing
- ❌ Social login integration with Firebase Auth
- ❌ UI integration for social login (if applicable)
- ❌ Tests for social authentication

#### Next Steps
1. Integrate social providers with Firebase Auth
2. Document client-side integration steps

## 4. Next Priority Steps

Based on the current state and dependencies between RFCs, the following steps should be prioritized:

1. **Complete RFC-003 (Newsletter CRUD):**
   - Implement update and delete operations for newsletters
   - Add proper ownership verification
   - Add validation and error handling

2. **Begin RFC-004 (Subscriber Management):**
   - Set up Firebase Firestore integration
   - Implement subscription and unsubscription flows
   - Set up email confirmation integration

3. **Improve Authentication (RFC-002):**
   - Create a middleware for consistent JWT verification
   - Fix environment variable naming
   - Document or implement password reset flow

4. **Enhance Project Structure (RFC-001):**
   - Add database migration system
   - Improve setup documentation
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

The completion of these steps will provide a solid foundation for implementing the remaining RFCs (RFC-005 through RFC-008).
